# OpenPyXL Learning Project

## Description
This repository exists to help me learn (2022-03-17) openpyxl module.
In addition to this, I will be getting better with push, pull, and merge 
commands within the VCS (github). 

Different things that I want to learn with this project include:
- How can I speed my processes up in excel
- Specifically, how can I automate copy and paste ranges from multiple 
workbooks into one single one.
- What about from one worksheet to another?
- Am I able to become __proficient__ using openpyxl? 
- Can I actually get to where Python is a usable tool for me? (this is my goal
however, if I can never figure anything out, then it will be a waste of my time)

## Installation 
Will need to create a virtual environment on PC, the will use the 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

(Must remember to update and make the `pip freeze > requirements.txt` first!)

Update this section on more details about the requirements

Other than this, it will be a pull request from git hub:

### Steps
cd to location we want to use
mkdir (not needed if on desktop)
git init
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
